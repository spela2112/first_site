			<h2>Introverts</h2>
			<p>Not sure if you're an <strong>introvert</strong>? If the above welcome sounds like music to your ears, chances are you're an introvert. It doesn't necessarily mean you're shy or feel uncomfortable around people, it just means you feel far <strong>more comfortable when you're alone, undisturbed and free</strong>. Many introverts describe it as <strong>'being off'</strong> which curiously is a concept extroverts seem unfamiliar with. So if that sounds like you, welcome, you'll like it here.</p>
			<p>If that <em>doesn't</em> sound like you and the thought of spending time alone with no one to talk to fills you with terror, you're probably <strong>an extrovert</strong> and may find some of the tips and ideas on this site a bit strange, but they might open your eyes to the other 40% of the population and how differently we perceive the world and our fellow humans.</p>
